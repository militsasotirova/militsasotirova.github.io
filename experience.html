							As I mentioned, I was on the Query Optimization team. The work I did as part of this team includes:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>I implemented the internal swapping of two aggregation stages for better performance.</li>
							<li>I implemented the pushdown of a $match stage before an unpack bucket stage to filter and reduce
								the number of documents needed to be examined in a time-series collection.
							</li>
							<li>I introduced a feature flag to allow for the execution of the $lookup and $graphLookup aggregation
								stages to occur in a distributed environment. As part of this work, I wrote new integration tests
								and updated existing ones to reflect the new specification. Furthermore, I modified the $graphLookup
								stage constraints in order to only permit its execution on the proper types of nodes.
							</li>
							<li>I designed and measured performance benchmarks for the MQL $graphLookup aggregation stage. I explored
								the consequences of using different collection sizes, limiting the recursion depth of the query, and using
								various document shapes as they affected the expected size of the result set. I also validated the results
								from executions of these benchmarks in distributed vs non-distributed environments and targeted vs non-targeted 
								queries.
							</li>
							<li>I presented all of this work at an end-of-summer presentation to my collegues.</li>

						<p>I am designing, developing, maintaining, and testing a Python application for nutrient flow 
							through a farm system. I collaborate with student team members and professors from universities 
							nationwide. I have multiple roles in this project, one being a technical lead: earlier this 
							year, I introduced the usage of databases in the project to store input and output data and 
							I have continued to work on this project. I am also involved in programming model developments, 
							mentoring new team members, and performing code reviews. Furthermore, I co-authored 
							<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/11/5/1373">this paper</a> which discusses the model's features and structure.

						<p>RuFaS is a simulation written in Python that models nutrient flow through a farm system based
							on user inputs as well as published research. There are four main modules: animal, soil, manure,
							and crop, and I primarily work in the animal module. This is an interdisciplinary project that performs
							a computer simulation of an
							animal/farm system. Even though I have no background in animal or farm science, I have contributed a
							significant amount to the code base for the simulation:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>I am currently the techical lead of the output and data analysis team, where we are 
								working to implement different options for data export and analysis for a more complete
								set of model outputs.
							</li>
							<li>When the data management team was active, I was its technical lead. We are using SQLite
								to store input data and persist results for future review (comparison of two runs, version
								to version comparisons, etc.). I led meetings on topic and assign weekly tasks to the members of the
								team.</li>
							<li>I restructured the animal module to accept more user input describing the pens in the farm, the
								life cycle of the animals, the general animal management strategy the user would like to simulate,
								and to perform the simulation based on the additional input. The restructuring also made the code
								more modular in nature, making the code easier to understand.</li>
							<li>I coded the ration formulation and manure excretion component calculations for lactating cows.
							</li>
							<li>I coded the output files for the animal module and added a feature for a different style of
								input
								to the simulation that is more intuitive for the general user.</li>
							<li>The project has an emphasis on documentation, as we want future developers to be able to easily
								contribute
								and users to be able to understand exactly what the simulation is doing.</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						<p>I presented my work in August 2019 and August 2020 at the RuFaS annual meeting to an audience of
							programmers,
							the general leaders of the project, and people from the agricultural industry who will use the final
							product in their
							company policy decisions. People from universities all over the country work on different aspects of
							RuFaS, and communicating our progress and issues is very
							important to the success of the project.</p>
